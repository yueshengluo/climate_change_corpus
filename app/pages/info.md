# Annotation Guidelines

## Background

- You are going to be presented with a list of sentences about climate change.
- These sentences are extracted from comments from the Change My View subreddit, where users post an opinion about a topic and ask for arguments from the opposing point of view.
- Each sentence will concern UP TO four sub-topics (i.e., from 0 to 4 sub-topics) related to climate change:
  - Economy
  - Humanity
  - Government
  - Science
- To help interpret sentences, the title of the post to which the commenter is responding will also be shown.

## Task

- For each of the above sub-topics, consider whether the sentence touches on that sub-topic.
- If the sentence does not touch on a sub-topic, select "None" under that sub-topic.
- If a sentence does touch on a sub-topic, then under that sub-topic, select from the following options:
- "Concerned" (about climate change): Select if either of the following applies:
  - The main idea or sentiment of the comment is to express concern about climate change.
  - The main idea of the comment is to advocate for a policy to combat climate change, or to highlight the beneficial but hypothetical or uncertain future consequences of a measure to combat climate change.
- "Not concerned": The commenter appears unconcerned about climate change or opposes measures (or a specific measure) to combat climate change.
- "Neutral": The comment mentions the sub-topic, but the commenter's attitude towards climate change and climate change solutions cannot be inferred.
- "Conflicted": Select if either of the following applies:
  - The comment expresses multiple opinions such that the commenter's overall attitude towards climate change is hard to gauge.
  - The intention of the comment is best described as listing pros and cons of some measure to combat climate change.
- If a sentence touches on multiple sub-topics, the selections under each of these sub-topics will be the same.
- If the sentence expresses multiple opinions such that their overall attitude towards climate change is hard to gauge, select "Neutral" under the relevant aspects.

## Example Annotations with Reasoning

- Sentence: "A majority of republicans, at least in my experience, absolutely deny the existence of any climate change."
  - The sentence does not touch on Industry, Consumers, or Scientists/Academia, so the selections under each of those will be "None".
  - Since the sentence does touch on Politics/Government, the selection under Politics/Government will be "Concerned about climate change", "Not concerned about climate change", or "Neutral".
  - The commenter appears to be concerned about climate change. Therefore, under Politics/Government, select “Concerned about climate change."

- Sentence: "As it stands right now, there is no feasible path to carbon neutrality without the widespread use of Nuclear Energy."
  - The sentence does not touch on Consumers or Scientists/Academia, so the selections under each of those will be "None".
  - Since the sentence does touch on Industry, the selections under Industry will be "Concerned about climate change", "Not concerned about climate change", or "Neutral".
  - The commenter appears to be concerned about climate change. Therefore, under Industry, select “Concerned about climate change."

- Sentence: "I agree that we need to invest more on renewables, but the GND sets some very lofty goals about reducing emissions that are impossible to meet."
  - This is a potentially ambiguous sentence: it definitely touches on Politics/Government, but it arguably touches on Industry as well since the barrier to lower emissions the commenter refers to may be related to industry limitations.
  - However, since it is not clear if this is the case, select "None" under Industry (as well as Scientists/Academia and Consumers).
  - Since this sentence reflects a mixed level of concern towards climate change, it would be best to "Neutral" under Politics/Government (although "Concerned" would also be defensible).
